# Frame 2

### Problem
A rectangle has a perimeter of 24 inches. What is the maximum possible area of the rectangle?

### Solution
[Let the length of the rectangle be ( l ), width be ( w ). We want to maximize the area ( A = lw ) subject to the constraint ( 2l + 2w = 24 ).]

### Problem
A rectangle has a perimeter of 24 inches. What is the maximum possible area of the rectangle?

### Solution
[Let the length of the rectangle be ( l )] [ and the width of the rectangle be ( w ). Since the perimeter of the rectangle is 24 inches, we have that ( 2l + 2w = 24 ), so ( l + w = 12 ). We wish to maximize the area of the rectangle, ]

# Frame 8

### Problem
A rectangle has a perimeter of 24 inches. What is the maximum possible area of the rectangle?

### Solution

**[ Let the length of the rectangle be ( l ) ]**
[ and the width of the rectangle be ( w ). Since the perimeter of the rectangle is 24 inches, we have that ( 2l + 2w = 24 ), so ( l + w = 12 ). We wish to maximize the area of the rectangle, ]
**[ which ]**
[ is ( A = lw ). Let ( l = 12 - w ) and plug into the area:

\[
A = (12 - w)w \quad \Rightarrow \quad A = 12w - w^2
\]

Now, we differentiate ( A ) with respect to ( w ):

\[
A'(w) = 12 - 2w
\]

We wish to maximize ( A ), so we set ( A'(w) = 0 ), and solve for ( w ):

\[
12 - 2w = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad w = 6
\]

Since ( l = 12 - w ), we have that ( l = 12 - 6 = 6 ). Therefore, the area of the rectangle is

\[
A = lw = 6 \cdot 6 = \boxed{36}
\]
